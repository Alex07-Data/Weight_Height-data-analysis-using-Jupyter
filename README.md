# Weight_Height-data-analysis-using-Jupyter
This project analyzes a dataset containing height and weight measurements to calculate additional metrics such as Body Mass Index (BMI) and age. The dataset is loaded and processed using Pandas and NumPy in Python.
Key Features:

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Basic statistics, dataset structure, and column information.

    BMI Calculation: Computes BMI for each individual using the formula:
    BMI=Weight (kg)/(Height*Height)
    

    Age Calculation: Assumes all individuals were born in 1998 and calculates their age in 2025.

Files:

    weight-height.csv: The dataset containing height and weight values.

    analysis.py: Python script for data processing and calculations.

This project is a simple exercise in data processing, basic statistical analysis, and feature engineering using Python.
